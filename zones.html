            zone to the point where sunlight does not reach. </p>
    
          <p class="txtwhite">It starts from 200 m to 1000 m and is home to the most 
              numerous vertebrates on Earth (small bristly fish). </p>
    
            <p class="txtwhite">
                Most of the creatures of this zone forage under the cover of night,

        <h1>The Midnight Zone </h1>
    
        <p class="txtwhite">This zone begins at the bottom of the mesopelagia and extends to 4,000 m. 
            The midnight zone is much larger than the twilight zone. It is the largest ecosystem on earth.  
        </p>
    
          <p class="txtwhite">The upper limit of this zone is marked by the complete absence of sunlight. 
              The organisms live there in complete darkness. 
              However, darkness can be disturbed by the light produced by the organisms themselves.</p>
    
            <p class="txtwhite">
              With this so-called bioluminescence can be used to attract a victim or find a partner.
               Some species have lost the ability to see anything at all.

        <h1>Abyssal zone </h1>
    
        <p class="txtwhite">Even deeper is the ellagic precipice, which extends from the bottom of the Batypelag to the seabed.
             This zone is characterized by a relative lack of life. It really is an abyss. 
    
        </p>
    
          <p class="txtwhite">Very few creatures live in low temperatures, high pressures, and complete darkness at this depth. 
              Several species of squid are among the species found in this zone; echinoderms, including starfish, 
              floating cucumber and guinea pig; and sea arthropods, including the sea spider.</p>
    
            <p class="txtwhite">
                Many species living at these depths are transparent and eyeless due to the complete lack of light in this zone.

         <h1>The Hadal zone</h1>
    
        <p class="txtwhite">The name comes from the kingdom of Hades, the Greek underworld. 
            It is the deepest part of the ocean at over 6,000 meters or 6,500 meters, according to authorities.
             Such depths are usually found in trenches.
    
        </p>
    
          <p class="txtwhite">A special zone that only exists in certain places in the world is called the hadopelagic zone.
               Where the flat seabed has deep, wide ditches, and the open water that fills them, there is hardly any life there.
                By this definition, all the deepest parts of the ocean end in a hadopelaga. 
                The deepest known ocean depth is almost 11,000 m, it is the Marian Trench.
