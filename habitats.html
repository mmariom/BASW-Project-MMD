    <h1>Abyssal Plain  </h1>

    <p class="txtwhite">The abyssal plain is the relatively level deep seafloor. 
      It is a cold and dark place that lies between 3,000 and 6,000 meters below the sea surface. </p>

      <p class="txtwhite">It is also home to squat lobsters, red prawns, and various species of sea cucumbers. 
        For these creatures food is scarce most of the time. </p>

        <p class="txtwhite">
          Bits of decaying matter and excretions from thousands of meters above must trickle down to the seafloor, 
          with only a small fraction escaping the hungry jaws of creatures above. </p>

    <h1>Whale Falls  </h1>

    <p class="txtwhite">For the majority of the ocean floor large animals are scarce. 
    </p>

      <p class="txtwhite">The little nutrition that rains down from above in the form of marine snow is not nearly consistent enough norsubstantive enough to fuel a large living creature (though there are billions of tiny ones).</p>

        <p class="txtwhite">
          Whale or other large animal deaths are different.  Whale falls occur when a
           whale dies in surface waters and sinks to the bottom of the ocean.

  <div class="articletext1">


    <p class="txtwhite">Trees, sharks, and large fish can also fall to the seafloor and provide food. The sudden arrival of food prompts creatures from afar to congregate and feast on the fleshy carcass. 

    </p>

      <p class="txtwhite">Once the flesh has been stripped and consumed by predators, bone eaters arrive so that not even the skeleton will remain. In the months and years after a whale fall the site will become the home and food source for millions of creatures. </p>

    <h1>Hydrothermal Vents  </h1>

    <p class="txtwhite">Deep beneath the ocean’s surface, towers spew scalding water from within the earth’s crust. These are hydrothermal vents. 

    </p>

      <p class="txtwhite">Hydrothermal vents exist in volcanically active areas. Seawater makes its way through the cracks in the earth’s crust until it reaches hot magma. </p>

        <p class="txtwhite">
          At first inspection, it seems unlikely that anything could live in such an environment—spewing from cracks in the earth’s crust is scalding water that has been heated to temperatures up to 400 degrees Celsius, a temperature hot enough to melt lead. These vents are also so deep that they never see a glimmer of light from the sun. 
</p>

      <p class="txtwhite">

            Despite these obstacles, clams, mussels, shrimp, and gigantic worms thrive in these habitats. Their existence is thanks to bacteria.  
          </p>

  </div>


  <div class="articletext1">


    <p class="txtwhite">Animal life at a hydrothermal vent relies on the energy produced by symbiotic bacteria. The bacteria live either inside the bodies or on the surface of their hosts. 

    </p>

      <p class="txtwhite">But unlike most life on earth that uses light from the sun as a source of energy, these bacteria produce energy through a chemical reaction that uses minerals from the vents.  </p>
